**Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**


Customer segmentation is a crucial strategy for businesses to understand and target different customer groups effectively. This project demonstrates how to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using Python and various data science techniques.

The project provides a structured and data-driven approach to customer segmentation two techniques:

**RFM Analysis:** This framework assesses customer behavior based on:
**Recent Customers:** How recently a customer made a purchase.

**Frequent Customers:** How often a customer makes a purchase.

**Money Spent:** How much money a customer spends.

**K-Means Clustering:** A machine learning algorithm that segments customers into clusters based on their RFM scores, revealing patterns and groups in customer behavior.

**Features**


**Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Import and clean customer data for analysis.


**Feature Engineering:** Create features to represent customer behavior.


**K-Means Clustering:** Use clustering algorithms to segment customers.


**Visualization:** Visualize the customer segments using pie charts and other plots.
