# 📊 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

Customer segmentation helps businesses effectively understand and target different customer groups. This project demonstrates how to segment customers based on purchasing behavior using **Python** and various data science techniques.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Techniques Used

1. **RFM Analysis**: Assesses customer behavior based on:
   - **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
   - **Frequency**: How often a customer makes a purchase.
   - **Monetary**: How much money a customer spends.

2. **K-Means Clustering**: Segments customers into clusters based on their RFM scores, revealing patterns in customer behavior.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Import and clean customer data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create meaningful features to represent customer behavior.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Apply clustering algorithms to segment customers.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the customer segments using pie charts and other plots.
